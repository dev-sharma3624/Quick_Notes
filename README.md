# üìù QuickNotes ‚Äì A Modern Jetpack Compose Notes App with Firebase

> QuickNotes is a modern Android notes application built entirely with Jetpack Compose. It combines the power of Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore to provide secure, user-specific, real-time note storage. Along with that, it uses a local Room database for offline-first support, so you can access your notes even when there‚Äôs no internet. Whether you‚Äôre a student, developer, or professional who needs to jot down ideas quickly, QuickNotes gives you a smooth, cloud-synced, offline-ready note-taking experience.

## üöÄ How to Run QuickNotes Locally

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/QuickNotes.git
cd QuickNotes
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Firebase Project**

-   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
-   Click **Add Project**, enter a name for your project, and click **Continue**.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Register Your Android App**

-   In the Firebase Console, navigate to your project and click **Add app** ‚Üí **Android**.
-   Enter your app‚Äôs package name (you can find this in `app/build.gradle` under `applicationId`).
-   Add your **SHA‚Äë1 fingerprint** to connect Google Sign-In. You can get it by running:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew signingReport
    ```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Download & Add `google-services.json`**

-   After registering the app, click **Download google-services.json**.
-   Place the downloaded file in the `app/` directory of your project (`app/google-services.json`).

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable Firebase Authentication**

-   In the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Sign-in method**.
-   Enable the **Google** provider.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable Cloud Firestore**

-   In the Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database** ‚Üí **Create Database**.
-   Select **Start in Test Mode** for development purposes.
-   Choose a server location that is nearest to you.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Firestore Security Rules**

-   Navigate to the **Rules** tab in your Firestore database and paste the following to ensure users can only access their own notes:
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId}/notes/{noteId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Firebase Dependencies**

-   Ensure the following dependencies are present in your Gradle files.

-   **`project/build.gradle`**
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.2")
        }
    }
    ```

-   **`app/build.gradle`**
    ```gradle
    plugins {
        id("com.google.gms.google-services")
    }

    dependencies {
        // Firebase
        implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-auth-ktx:23.0.0")
        implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore-ktx:25.0.0")

        // Room
        implementation("androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1")
        implementation("androidx.room:room-ktx:2.6.1")
        kapt("androidx.room:room-compiler:2.6.1")
    }
    ```

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Sync & Run**

-   Open the project in Android Studio.
-   Let Gradle sync the dependencies.
-   Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## üìå How it Works

1.  When a user signs in with their Google account, **Firebase Authentication** verifies their identity and provides a unique user ID (`uid`).
2.  All notes are stored in **Cloud Firestore** under a path that includes this `uid`, ensuring strict user data isolation:
    ```
    users/{uid}/notes/{noteId}
    ```
3.  Real-time updates are achieved using **snapshot listeners**, which automatically sync data between the app and the cloud.
4.  For offline access, notes are also cached locally in the **Room Database**.
5.  On sign-out, the local database is cleared, and the real-time listeners are detached to secure the user's data.
